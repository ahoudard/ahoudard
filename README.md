### Hello

I'm a researcher with interests on image processing, 3D rendering and computer vision. I worked on image restoration, texture synthesis, super-resolution, and neural rendering. I developped methods using statistics [HDMI](https://github.com/ahoudard/HDMI), optimal transport [wgenpatex](https://github.com/ahoudard/wgenpatex) and deep learning [GOTEX](https://github.com/ahoudard/GOTEX).

I'm currently working as Research Engineer at Ubisoft La Forge Bordeaux.
