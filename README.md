### Hello

I'm a researcher with interests on image processing. More precisely I worked on image restauration, texture synthesis, super-resolution, rendering. I developped methods using statistics [HDMI](https://github.com/ahoudard/HDMI), optimal transport [wgenpatex](https://github.com/ahoudard/wgenpatex) and deep learning [GOTEX](https://github.com/ahoudard/GOTEX).

I'm currently working as Research Engineer at Ubisoft La Forge Bordeaux.
